# Minesweeper

To train myself on javascript, I wanted to create my own version of the minesweeper game. 
The aim of the game is to find the mines by placing flags on a grid. By clicking on the squares of the grid, the player can find out where the mines are and place a flag to prevent clicking on them. If he clicks on a mine, the game is lost.

I only used html, css and javascript.
